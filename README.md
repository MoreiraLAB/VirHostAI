## ViralBindPredict

## Abstract:
The development of a single drug can cost up to 1.8 billion USD and require over a decade, timelines that contemporary pharmaceutical companies seek to expedite. Computational methodologies have become
integral to drug discovery; however, traditional approaches, such as docking simulations, often rely on protein   and   ligand   structures   that   are   unavailable,   incomplete,   or   lack   sufficient   accuracy.
Notwithstanding advances such as AlphaFold in predicting protein structures, these models are not always sufficiently precise for identifying Ligand-Binding Sites (LBS) or Drug-Target Interactions (DTI).
In this study, we introduce ViralBindPredict, an innovative Deep-Learning (DL) model designed to predict LBS   in   viral   proteins   using   sequence-based   data.   Our   approach   leverages   sequence-derived
information from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), offering a faster and more accessible alternative to structure-based   methods.   ViralBindPredict   classifies   viral   protein   residues   as   interacting   or   non-
interacting with ligands based on a 5 Ã… threshold, unlocking new avenues for antiviral drug discovery. To enhance performance, we extracted advanced descriptors from protein-ligand complexes and
applied autoencoders for dimensionality reduction of protein features. ViralBindPredict was rigorously evaluated across key metrics, achieving an accuracy of 0.68, AUC-ROC of 0.74, F1-Score of 0.65,
precision of 0.69, and recall of 0.62. These results establish ViralBindPredict as an effective instrument for accelerating drug development,
especially in the realm of antiviral treatment, where time and resource limitations are often crucial. The ability   of   the   model   to   overcome   conventional   constraints   and   generate   dependable   predictions
demonstrates its potential to substantially influence the pharmaceutical industry .

### Prerequisites:
ViralBindPredict was developed and tested as follows:
* Python 3.11
* MORDRED - version 1.2.0
* RDKit - version 2023.9.4
* numpy - version 1.26.3
* pandas - version 2.2.0 
* scipy - version 1.12.0
* h5py - version 3.10.0

We recommend creating an isolated Conda environment to run our pipeline, which can be performed using the following code:
```bash

conda activate ViralBindPredict
```
Note: The environment name, defined after the "--name" argument in the first step, can be whatever the user desires.
